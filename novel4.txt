There are many ways to show true love, and keeping promises is also one of them. When I was 8 years old, I was in the third grade of elementary school. My older sister, who was in middle school, was a very beautiful girl, and our relatives and friends spoiled her a lot. Before the Spring Festival, my aunt gave her a stylish pink shirt as a New Year's gift when she returned from Guangzhou on business. In my eyes full of envy and even jealousy, my sister carefully put the clothes away in the wardrobe, eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the new year. On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, the neighbor's elder brother's girlfriend visited for the first time, and my uncle and aunt did not prepare a gift for her. At this moment, my father sent the new clothes to my sister without hesitation and helped to promote a happy marriage. That night, my uncle came to our house and kept thanking us while giving money to buy the clothes, but my father insisted on not taking it. After seeing off my uncle, he stopped me from mocking my sister and comforted her, promising that she would wear the new clothes on the new year's day. However, my sister ignored my father and cried in mother's arms feeling wronged. At that time, my parents' monthly salary was less than 100 yuan, and our family was not particularly well-off. Moreover, we lived in a remote small town where such beautiful clothes were not available. Therefore, my sister thought that having that pink color again was just a wish. The next day was the thirty-first day of the twelfth lunar month, and my father got up early in the morning with only 30 yuan in our family budget and took a long-distance bus to go to Beijing. He went to many shops and department stores in the city, from Xidan to Dongdan, Wangfujing to Qianmen Dajie, until he finally found a shirt that looked and felt the same as the one given by my aunt. In the evening twilight, my father hurriedly returned home after setting down the shocked sister and put the clothes in her hands without saying a word. Looking at my father cleaning and bandaging his arm that was bruised when he pushed through the crowd bus on his way back, I asked: "Dad, why did you insist on buying clothes?" My father gently patted my head and said simply: "Let your sister have a happy new year." Tears slowly blurred my vision, and a deep love reached the depths of my young heart through my father's fingers.
